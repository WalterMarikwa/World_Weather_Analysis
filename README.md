## Part 1 - Retrieve Weather Data
To start, a Python script was made to Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. 

- The following information from the API call includes:  
     -	Latitude and longitude
     - Maximum temperature
     - Percent humidity
     -	Percent cloudiness
     -	Wind speed
     -	Weather description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky)

## Part 2 - Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Utilizing input explanations to recover client climate inclinations, at that point taking those inclinations to recognize potential travel goals and adjacent inns. At that point, appearing those goals on a marker layer outline with pop-up markers.

## Part 3 - Create a Travel Itinerary Map 
Using the Google Bearings API to form a travel schedule that appears the course between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s conceivable travel goals. At that point, making a marker layer outline with a pop-up marker for each city on the agenda.

- A marker layer map with a pop-up markers for the cities on the itinerary was created and each marker has the following information:
     -	Hotel name
     -	City
     -	Country
     -	Current weather description with the maximum temperature
